Name any PNG image as example.jpg (Recommended maximum pixel: 300x300)
Code will first turn the image into greyscale image

Package Needed: Ghostscript, Python Turtle, ...

Run:
python hilbert.py
python hilbert_art.py

Minimize the window will make py turtle run extremely fast, but the order3 hilbert curve in
hilbert_art.py seems bad in the result hilbert_art.png, while seems good in the py turtle window.
